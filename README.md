# Flight Price Prediction
By: Sardor Sobirov

# Introduction
The goal is to analyze a dataset to predict flight fares using machine learning techniques. The focus will be on conducting essential exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying patterns and trends within the data. We will then draw predictions about flight prices based on various features such as airline type, arrival time, departure time, flight duration, source, destination, and more.

##Key Takeaways:

1. Comprehensive EDA Process:

Gain a thorough understanding of the EDA process using a machine learning dataset.
Extract valuable insights from the dataset through mathematical analysis and visualization.

2. Data Visualization:

Utilize visualization techniques to gain a better understanding of the data.
Identify patterns and trends that are crucial for making accurate predictions.
Feature Engineering:

3.

Explore different approaches to feature engineering.
Enhance the dataset by creating new features that can improve model performance.
